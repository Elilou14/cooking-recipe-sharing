# cooking-recipe-sharing
a site for sharing cooking recipes. For a cooking recipe sharing site, it's simple:  Users connect: they have a name, an e-mail, a password, an age...  They consult or create recipes: they have a title, a body (the recipe), an activation status...  And so on for each of the objects that make up your project.
